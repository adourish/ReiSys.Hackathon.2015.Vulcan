            About Us
        </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to REI systems Hackathon 2015 Team Vulcan’s project.
            Our goal for this hackathon is to have fun learning some new technologies, implement
            our ideas and showcase it to our fellow co-workers and the world. Our approach
            for this hackathon was to pick technologies that we are not familiar at all or
            barely knew. The technology section we will detail the list of technologies
            that we have used for this.

            Hackathon 2015
        </h1>
        <p>
            REI systems has been conducting hackathon annually since
            2012 and developers strive to bring their ideas into implementation via this
            platform. There were many innovative ideas that have come through this platform
            and REI and its employees cherish this innovative cut throat competition on
            innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            This year, REI decided to encourage innovation in data and decision
            analytics by providing 3 publically available datasets and asking competitors
            to develop a concept and focus on innovation, technologies, usability and quality
            of code.

            Team Vulcans
        </h1>
        <p>
            Some interested folks gathered together and we decided to
            build a team. Carefully considering each ones skillset the requirements for the
            project, we were able to identify individuals we needed to ensure we are all
            guns blazing and have individuals that specialize in at least one aspect of the
            requirements needed to build this project successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of our team is simple, we are <span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Vulcans</span><span style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:107%'>
                (<span>
                    Tend to live by
                    reason and logic with no interference from emotion),
                </span>
            </span>
            when we were choosing a name for our team, the characteristics of data and
            decision analytics that were identified represented so much the Vulcan concept
            that this was the most appropriate name for the work we wanted to do.

            Project
        </h1>
        <p>
            Our project uses FEMAs disaster declaration datasets. The
            idea is simple – use the data to build visualizations for FEMA executives that
            can tell them Past Performance, Current Ongoing Projects and Prediction of what
            is coming.

            History
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our History section shows FEMS executives and general public
            how FEMA has done in the past years, how much money it has cost for which types
            of disasters in what state.

            Our Current Section takes FEMA executives to a current FEMA
            dashboard <a href="https://itdashboard.gov/investment?buscid=165">https://itdashboard.gov/investment?buscid=165</a>.
            Our idea was that FEMA executives will already have a dashboard designed to
            meet their current needs and more data than we have in publically available
            APIs. Hence we decided to keep this as a link that can take them to existing implementation.

        <p>
            This forms the heart of our project. We invested significant
            time and resources to learn Machine Learning in Azure and trained the data to
            provide future predictions based on clustering. Our technology section will
            describe in detail our technology stack and the machine learning flow that we
            used to build the predictions.
