            Technology
        </h1>
        <p>
            Our approach on picking up the technology was multifaceted.
            We considered the following before picking up the technology stack for this
            project.
        </p>

        <p>
            1. Requirements of the project: The first
            and fore most important thing we were looking at was what is the requirement of
            the project and which stack and best suit its needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. Learning something new: We wanted to
            apply this principle to our Hackathon experience and ensure that we do not use
            technology that we use in our day to day work or are were using it earlier. The
            bottom-line line was that we wanted to use a technology that we are not
            proficient in so that the learner comer out of its hiding from within us.
        </p>

        <p>
            3. REIs core offerings and future capacity:
            We wanted to keep in mind the key goals of our corporation and help enhance its
            resource pool in technologies that are looking towards the future, technologies
            that will shape REI system’s tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>
            With that in mind we decided with the following technology
            stack:

        <p>
            Azure cloud was the perfect match for us to experiment clout
            technology since REI’s one of the biggest client uses Microsoft platform and cloud
            is a natural next step in distant future.

            REIs HS business unit is already looking to move to Team
            Foundation Server (TFS) as ALM solution. We the Vulcan’s here wanted to learn
            and be ahead in curve and used TFS as our code repository.

            Vulcan’s goal from the start was to implement a responsive
            UI and we achieved that goal with flying colors. The UI can be ported to any
            technology and platform since it does not contain .NET specific code.

            Our data expert was familiar with Weka software’s machine

            ventured in Azure Machine Learning module and obtained great success. The heart
